## How To Use

- Type solve in the textfield to find the shortest path from the red block to the blue block

- Type make in the textfield to generate a random maze guarantee one path only

- Type reset in the textfield to reset the walls and paths

- Type setResolution to set the resolution of the map

- Type export to export the current map to the directory you chosed

- Type import to import map from the directory you chosed

- Press 1 to move the red block around

- Press 2 to move the blue block around

- press 3 to add walls on the map

- press 4 to remove walls on the map

## Features

- BFS breath first search path finding algorithm to find the shortest path

- DFS depth first search path back trace algorithm to generate random maze
