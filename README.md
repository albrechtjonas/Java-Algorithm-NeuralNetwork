# Java-Algorithm-NeuralNetwork

## Contributor List

- Dominic Jiang for the full algorithm development

## How To Get This Algorithm On Your Device

- Download Demo.jar file on your computer

- Make sure JDK has been installed

- Open terminal and type java -jar (directory of Demo.jar file)

## How To Use

- DataSet: {1,0,0,1},{1,0,1,1},{1,1,0,1},{1,1,1,1},{0,1,1,0},{0,1,0,0},{0,0,1,0},{0,0,0,0}

- The first three element as inputs and the last element in each array as output

- As you can see no matter what the second and the third inputs are, the output will always be the same as the first input

- After training, Enter 3 numbers (the first three input) and you will see the output

## Features

- Sigmoid function and derivative sigmoid (rate of change at a certain point) as the neural activated function

- Using linear digression to fix the weights
